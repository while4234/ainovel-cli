# Git Notes

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains the `ainovel-cli` Go command line application and its
supporting assets, documentation, scripts, and tests.

## Ignore And Secret Policy

Local executables, generated build/release artifacts, workspaces, output
directories, editor files, and local `.ainovel/` configuration are ignored.
Never commit provider credentials, API keys, `.env` values, private keys,
cookies, or raw local auth paths. Safe example configuration files may be
tracked when they contain placeholders only.

## Project GitHub Rule

For this project, a completed future development task is not done until the
intentional changes are committed and pushed to the configured GitHub remote
(`origin`) unless the user explicitly says not to push for that task.

## Current Baseline

- Latest upstream source commit: `7bafcc6` `fix: scope adaptation writer guidance`
- Branch: `main`
- Remote: `origin` -> `https://github.com/while4234/ainovel-cli.git`
- Working tree: has known untracked local workspace directory `ds_xfk/`
- Validation: latest pull, compile-only tests, local CLI build, and
  cross-directory PATH/shim smoke succeeded on 2026-06-30

## Change Log

- 2026-06-30 `docs: record global CLI sync`: rebuild
  `D:\ainovel\ainovel-cli.exe` from `7bafcc6`, add `D:\ainovel` to the current
  user's PATH, install `D:\grok\bin\ainovel-cli.cmd` for already-opened PATH
  environments, and verify `ainovel-cli --version` from outside the repo in
  both PowerShell and cmd.
- 2026-06-30 `7bafcc6` `fix: scope adaptation writer guidance`: pulled latest
  upstream code from GitHub and rebuilt the local runtime executable.
- 2026-06-30 `1dd5d60` `fix: stabilize retries and TUI input rendering`: shared
  retry policy now uses 7 attempts with increasing delay for co-create,
  structured source analysis, user-rule normalization, and subagent calls. TUI
  co-create failures now show an actionable retry/start prompt, and global input
  rendering is clamped to one line so completed/export states do not flood the
  terminal with repeated placeholders.
- 2026-06-30 `928a008` `fix: choose adaptation mode before cocreate`: mode
  selection for novel adaptation now happens immediately after source
  preparation and before adaptation co-create. Validation passed for startup,
  TUI, headless, host/adapt/flow, CLI parsing, and local/global build sync;
  `internal/tools` still hit existing Windows TempDir cleanup failures only.
- 2026-06-30 `3bb376f` `feat: stabilize adaptation source preparation`: pulled
  latest upstream code from GitHub.
- 2026-06-30 `docs: record restart validation`: record successful local rebuild
  and restart after updating to the latest GitHub code.
- 2026-06-30 `docs: update git notes after latest pull`: refresh baseline
  after updating to the latest GitHub code.
- 2026-06-30 `68e1f33` `fix: auto-run simulate from palette`: pulled latest
  upstream code from GitHub.
- 2026-06-30 `docs: add project git maintenance notes`: record project GitHub
  push rule and baseline.

## Rollback Notes

- To inspect the latest upstream pull: `git log --oneline --decorate -5`.
- To undo only the local notes commit after review, use `git revert <commit>`.
- Do not delete or stage `ds_xfk/` unless the user explicitly asks to track that
  local workspace.
